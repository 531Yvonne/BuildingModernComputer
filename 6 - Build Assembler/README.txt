# This source code contains an assembler program to convert .asm input to binary code at a .hack file to the same directory as the input file.

* This is a python3 program, no need to compile.

* To run the code: run the line below in your command line in the src directory:

python3 project6.py <replace by the path of your input file (including filename.asm)>

the corresponding .hack output file will be generated to the same directory
